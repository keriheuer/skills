# Source of Truth Creator — Prior Art

**Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-28

---

## Overview

The Source of Truth Creator skill synthesizes proven frameworks from multiple domains into a lightweight, practitioner-focused tool. This document acknowledges the extensive prior art and identifies what's actually new.

**Key principle:** We're not claiming to invent epistemic calibration or integrated quality frameworks. Those exist and are more sophisticated than what we offer. Our contribution is **practical accessibility** — a simple checklist and template format for technical writers and founders who don't have time for 9-dimensional frameworks or automated pipelines.

## Key Prior Art Frameworks

### Staleness Measurement Framework (Chayka et al. 2012)

**Citation:** Chayka, O., Palpanas, T., Bouquet, P. (2012). "Defining and Measuring Data-Driven Quality Dimension of Staleness." University of Trento, DISI Technical Report 12-016.

**What it does:** Provides a mathematical framework for measuring data staleness, including:
- Exponential smoothing for update frequency prediction
- Freshness vs staleness measurement methodology
- Aggregation approaches for data quality assessment

**Validation:** Tested on Wikipedia revision history data using exponential smoothing method.

**Relevance:** Staleness is arguably the most technically complex of our six failure modes. This framework provides the mathematical foundation — our "staleness markers" are a simplified practitioner version of this research.

### Software Documentation Quality Framework (Treude et al. 2020)

**Citation:** Treude, C., Middleton, J., Atapattu, T. (2020). "Beyond Accuracy: Assessing Software Documentation Quality." In *Proceedings of ESEC/FSE '20*, ACM.

**10 dimensions:**
1. Quality (spelling, grammar)
2. Appeal (engagement)
3. Readability
4. Understandability
5. Structure
6. Cohesion
7. Conciseness
8. Effectiveness
9. Consistency
10. Clarity

**Integration method:** Synthesizes Wang & Strong (1996), Eppler (16 dimensions), Knight & Burn (20 dimensions), and readability research.

**Validation:** Empirical testing with 4 technical editors across 41 documents in 5 genres.

**Relevance:** Demonstrates that integrating multiple quality dimensions is standard practice in documentation research. Their 10-dimension framework is more comprehensive than our 6 failure modes.

---

### Medical Data Quality Framework (Tsave et al. 2025)

**Citation:** Tsave, O., Kosvyra, A., Filos, D.T., Chouvarda, I. (2025). "A Multi-Dimensional Framework for Data Quality Assurance in Cancer Imaging Repositories." *Cancers*, 17(19):3213.

**5 dimensions:**
1. Completeness
2. Validity
3. Consistency
4. Integrity
5. Fairness

**Deployment:** Part of EU-funded INCISIVE project for pan-European cancer imaging repository.

**Relevance:** Demonstrates multi-dimensional data quality frameworks with automated validation — more technically sophisticated than our checklist approach.

---

### OHAT Systematic Review Framework (Rooney et al. 2014)

**Citation:** Rooney, A.A., Boyles, A.L., Wolfe, M.S., Bucher, J.R., Thayer, K.A. (2014). "Systematic Review and Evidence Integration for Literature-Based Environmental Health Science Assessments." *Environmental Health Perspectives*, 122(7):711-718.

**Confidence rating system:** Four levels (High, Moderate, Low, Very Low) with explicit downgrade/upgrade criteria.

**Adoption:** Adapted from GRADE methodology used by Cochrane Collaboration. Influenced EPA and other regulatory bodies' systematic review approaches.

**Relevance:** Our confidence marking concept is a simplified version of what OHAT formalized 11 years earlier.

## Sources for Individual Failure Modes

### GRADE Framework (Healthcare)

**What it is:** Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation

**Four confidence levels:**
- HIGH — Very confident effect lies close to estimate
- MODERATE — Moderately confident; true effect likely close
- LOW — Limited confidence; true effect may be substantially different
- VERY LOW — Very little confidence in estimate

**What we learned:** The four-level system is well-validated. We adapted it for documentation context.

**Reference:** gdt.gradepro.org; BMJ, Cochrane Collaboration

### ICD 203 (Intelligence Community)

**What it is:** Intelligence Community Directive on Analytic Standards

**Key distinctions:**
- **Likelihood** — Probability of event occurring ("remote" to "nearly certain")
- **Confidence** — Analyst's confidence in the BASIS for judgment
- **Information** — Facts from sources
- **Assumptions** — Suppositions bridging gaps
- **Judgments** — Conclusions based on information + assumptions

**What we learned:** Separating likelihood from confidence prevents conflation. The Information/Assumptions/Judgments framework is powerful.

**Reference:** dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD-203.pdf [STABLE]

---

### IIA Audit Standards (Self-Assessment)

**What it is:** Institute of Internal Auditors quality assurance standards

**Key requirement:** All self-assessments must be validated by independent external assessors at least once every five years.

**Empirical validation:** Self-assessment inflation is well-documented in audit literature:
- Karapetrovic & Willborn (2001) established the comparison framework between self-assessment and external audit (162 citations)
- Baker (2022) found statistically significant inflation in self-accreditation scores vs third-party audits (z = -6.4376, p < 0.05, n=73 SMBs)

**What we learned:** Self-assessment bias is empirically documented. Explicit labeling is essential.

---

### PRISMA/Cochrane (Absence Claims)

**What it is:** Standards for systematic review reporting

**Key findings:** 
- In 2001-2002, 21.3% of Cochrane review abstracts made unqualified "no effect" claims (Alderson & Chalmers 2003)
- By 2017, this dropped to 7.8% (Marson Smith et al. 2021)
- Shows the principle is well-known but implementation took 15+ years to improve significantly

**PRISMA 2020 requirement:** "Clearly indicate if studies were ineligible because outcomes were NOT measured."

**What we learned:** Absence claim hedging is established methodology but poorly implemented in practice. Templates that enforce marking may help adoption.

- PRISMA 2020. BMJ 2021;372:n71

---

### Data Freshness (DAMA-DMBOK)

**What it is:** Data Management Body of Knowledge — data quality framework

**Key concepts:**
- Maximum data delay thresholds
- Freshness alerts and monitoring
- Update schedules and staleness tracking

**What we learned:** Freshness tracking is well-solved for data. We translated it to documentation (staleness markers).

**References:**
- DAMA-DMBOK 2.0
- Chayka et al. (2012) — mathematical formalization

## What We're NOT Claiming

1. **Not inventing integrated frameworks** — Treude (10 dimensions), Tsave (5 dimensions), OHAT (7 step framework) all predate us
2. **Not inventing confidence levels** — GRADE has done this for 20+ years
3. **Not inventing self-assessment warnings** — IIA Standards predate us by decades
4. **Not inventing absence claim hedging** — PRISMA/Cochrane established this
5. **Not inventing staleness measurement** — Chayka et al. mathematically formalized this in 2012
6. **Not claiming "first integrated framework"** — multiple exist with greater sophistication

## What We ARE Claiming

**Practical accessibility for documentation teams:**

1. A simple 8-item checklist (vs 9-10 dimension frameworks)
2. Copy-paste templates (vs academic methodologies)
3. Markdown format for technical writers
4. No automation required (vs production pipelines)
5. Readable in 10 minutes (vs journal papers)

**Our value proposition is simplicity, not sophistication.**
